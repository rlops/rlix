RL researchers often need to run many experiments to test new ideas, compare configurations, and run ablations, but GPU clusters have limited capacity, so experiments can wait a long time to start. This is especially painful in agentic RL, where multi-turn rollouts are slow and uneven. A small number of slow rollouts can delay the whole job while most GPUs sit idle.

RLix is a GPU cluster manager that helps researchers use the same GPUs more efficiently. It lets multiple RL jobs share GPU capacity, so more experiments can run at the same time, wait times become shorter, and overall GPU usage goes up. When one job is not using all of its GPU capacity, RLix gives that spare capacity to other jobs and takes it back when needed. RLix changes how GPU capacity is shared, not how each pipeline trains. Each pipeline keeps the same training behavior as it would in an isolated RL experiment.

RLix is inspired by **Partial Overlapping** scheduling from [**Alibaba/ROLL**](https://github.com/alibaba/ROLL) and applies the idea to coordinating multiple independent training jobs on a shared GPU cluster.

RLix was developed with substantial AI assistance across design, planning, implementation, testing, and code review, with human oversight throughout. Correctness, code quality, and maintainability remain primary goals.

## Features

- **Keep each pipeline's training logic unchanged**: RLix separates GPU scheduling from training logic, so each pipeline can keep the same training behavior it would have in isolation.
- **Share resources across jobs and within Multi-LoRA pipelines**: Full-finetune pipelines share GPU capacity across jobs, while Multi-LoRA pipelines further share one base model across multiple adapters within a pipeline.
- **Grow and shrink rollouts based on demand**: Rollout workers expand into idle GPU capacity and shrink when that capacity is needed elsewhere.
- **Keep rollout memory usage low**: Rollout workers load inference weights only when they are active. Weights are cached on the trainer CPU, synchronized on resume, and dropped again when workers shrink.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlops/rlix.git
cd rlix
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

The example below shows a minimal RLix setup for starting one pipeline under RLix management.

Workflow overview:

1. Initialize RLix and get the orchestrator.
2. Allocate a pipeline ID.
3. Register the pipeline's GPU layout and namespace.
4. Admit the pipeline so RLix can schedule it.
5. Create the pipeline coordinator.
6. Create the pipeline actor and run it.

```python
import ray
import rlix
from rlix.pipeline import PipelineCoordinator
from rlix.protocol.types import COORDINATOR_ACTOR_NAME_PREFIX

# Pipeline-specific configuration object
my_config = ...

# 1. Initialize RLix
orchestrator = rlix.init(create_if_missing=True)

# 2. Allocate a pipeline ID
pipeline_id = ray.get(orchestrator.allocate_pipeline_id.remote("ft"))

# 3. Register the pipeline's GPU topology
ray.get(
    orchestrator.register_pipeline.remote(
        pipeline_id=pipeline_id,
        ray_namespace=f"pipeline_{pipeline_id}_NS",
        cluster_tp_configs={"actor_train": 8, "actor_infer": 8},
        cluster_device_mappings={
            "actor_train": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
            "actor_infer": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
        },
    )
)

# 4. Admit the pipeline before GPU allocation
ray.get(orchestrator.admit_pipeline.remote(pipeline_id=pipeline_id))

# 5. Create the pipeline coordinator
CoordinatorActor = ray.remote(PipelineCoordinator)
coordinator = CoordinatorActor.options(
    name=f"{COORDINATOR_ACTOR_NAME_PREFIX}{pipeline_id}",
    namespace=f"pipeline_{pipeline_id}_NS",
).remote(pipeline_id=pipeline_id, pipeline_config=my_config)

# 6. Create and run the pipeline
pipeline_actor = ray.get(
    coordinator.create_pipeline_actor.remote(pipeline_config=my_config)
)
ray.get(pipeline_actor.run.remote())
```

See [examples/](examples/) for complete multi-pipeline examples and full configuration options.

## Pipeline Types

RLix currently supports two built-in pipeline types:

### Full Finetune Pipeline (`RollFullFinetunePipeline`)

Full-parameter training with elastic GPU expand and shrink. Each job trains all model weights while allowing idle GPU capacity to be used by other jobs.

### Multi-LoRA Pipeline (`RollMultiLoraPipeline`)

Concurrent training of multiple LoRA adapters on a shared base model, with a separate optimizer for each adapter. Jobs share the base model in GPU memory while keeping adapter weights and optimizer states independent.

RLix also supports custom pipelines and integrations that follow the RLix interface.

## Architecture

RLix has one shared cluster management layer and one coordinator for each pipeline. The shared layer manages GPU allocation across jobs, while each pipeline keeps its own training logic.

## Scheduling Policy

RLix gives GPUs to higher-priority stages first. Most stages keep their GPUs until they finish. Rollout is the flexible stage: it can use spare GPU capacity when available and give it back when higher-priority work needs it.

Rollout has the lowest priority and is always preemptable. When multiple jobs are rolling out at the same time, RLix divides the available GPU capacity based on how much rollout work each job still has to do, while respecting placement constraints.

* **0 Initialization**: Model loading; must complete before scheduling begins.
* **1 Actor Training**: Policy gradient update.
* **2 Critic Training**: Value function update.
* **3 Old-Policy Log Probs**: Log-probability computation under the previous policy.
* **4 Reference-Model Log Probs**: Log-probability computation under the reference model.
* **5 Value Compute**: Value estimation for advantage calculation.
* **6 Rollout**: Trajectory sampling; always preemptable.
